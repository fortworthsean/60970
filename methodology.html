        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This reserach paper was completed via qualitative research methods. The full text and sources may be found below. I sought to make my academic research more research more accessible to a web audience. I have included content reasoning in my README.md file.</p>
        <p>This is the first trail at making my research content web firendly. While not perfect, I am very happy with my progress.</p>
        <h2>Original Full Text - Indigenous Agency in Colonial Latin America</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Indigenous populations in the Americas navigated, adapted to, and resisted Spanish colonial frameworks with varying degrees of success following the Spanish conquest that began in the late fifteenth century. Spanish explorers aimed to control Native American populations and subject them to Spanish rule. However, Native Americans actively sought to maintain agency, or some semblance of freedom, by adapting to the profound changes brought by European arrival. This quest for agency is evident in their impact on colonial governments, urban development, society, and economic structures.
</P>
<h3>Government</H3>
<P>
Native American populations were incredibly diverse and widespread throughout the Americas. Tribes spoke individual languages, possessed unique governmental forms, and forged regional alliances and rivalries, much like societies in other parts of the world. These distinct attributes persisted after the arrival of Europeans and significantly shaped the newly formed colonial governments through both alliances and insurrections.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous communities frequently advocated for government structures that promoted their livelihoods and voiced their individual communities' interests. Negotiations with the Spaniards often revolved around forming alliances and establishing forms of government control that indigenous populations valued. A key mechanism for this was the indigenous municipal council. These councils, which often mirrored or evolved from pre-Hispanic forms of local governance like the altepetl in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, provided a platform for native leaders to engage with colonial authorities, manage communal affairs, and maintain some autonomy within the Spanish system.  The ability to leverage these structures allowed indigenous groups to place their "stamp" on colonial governance, influencing local administration and maintaining a degree of self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Spanish authorities often exploited existing rivalries between native tribes to further their own imperial goals, impacting power dynamics among indigenous groups. Alliances were sometimes crucial for direct combat against Spanish rulers, but they were also strategically employed by native groups to work alongside the Spanish in pacifying rival tribes, showcasing the complex and often pragmatic choices made by indigenous leaders in a shifting political landscape. Wars, acts of violence, and attempted insurrections were also significant, demonstrating overt resistance to Spanish dominance.
</P>
<H3>Urban Development and Colonial Society</H3>
<P>
Indigenous populations in colonial America had an immense impact on urban development and colonial society. Spanish authorities systematically promoted urban development strategies centered around grid-pattern planning and plazas, which served as commercial, religious, and administrative hubs designed to promote social order and Spanish goals.  Important Spanish figures, like Hernán Cortés, built his residence directly over Montezuma's home near the central plaza of Mexico City, symbolically asserting his authority.  While Spanish elites were housed nearest to the plaza, indigenous populations were typically relegated to less desirable wards and barrios, signifying their lower place in the new social hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Indigenous communities often found ways to reshape Spanish imposed community designs. In some cases, the politically designed layers of authority within city wards were broken by the blending of neighborhoods, altering the intended social control of Spanish authorities.  This suggests that despite Spanish attempts at rigid spatial and social segregation, the lived reality of colonial cities was more fluid, with indigenous residents finding ways to adapt their living spaces.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, indigenous populations profoundly influenced colonial society. In some instances, tribes were able to gain positions of authority in society or form ethnic affiliations that allowed them to exert influence.  Colonial society was a complex blend of colonial settlers, Native Americans, and African enslaved populations, resulting in varying adjustments to societal hierarchies. Indigenous culture, too, left an indelible mark. Native languages sometimes became the predominant spoken language in a community, particularly in areas with large indigenous populations.  Furthermore, native culinary arts significantly shaped community diets and marketplaces, demonstrating a pervasive cultural influence that persisted despite colonial impositions. 
</P>
<H3>Economy</H3>
Colonial communities were heavily dependent on indigenous labor for their economic viability. While many were subjected to forced labor systems, some native populations actively migrated to colonial cities seeking economic opportunities, particularly in mining centers or larger administrative hubs.  This voluntary migration, though often driven by dire circumstances in rural areas, represents a form of agency where indigenous individuals adapted to the new economic realities by engaging with the colonial urban economy.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>
Native Americans profoundly shaped colonial life, demonstrating varying levels of success in maintaining agency within colonial society by imprinting their influence on colonial governments, urban development, society, and economic structures. While direct attempts by Native Americans to resist or adapt to Spanish rule sometimes faced immense challenges and even failed, their impact on colonial life was undeniably significant. These impacts are vividly seen throughout the survival or transformation of spatial, social, and naming practices that defined the colonial era.
