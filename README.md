Wow. This has been a fun, rewarding, and very stressful leanring experience. I am not done yet and have spent hours deleting and adjusting code. I think I am going to have some cleanup to do, but this has been agreat learnign experience. Because I was completing this project more independently, based on what I havw already been taight, it forced me to reflect and review on many concepts from class. I enjoy hands-on learning.

I thought I would go with a grid at first, but my subject matter felt direct enough to go with a flex only. I created a seperate gridtesting file (I did not want to ammend the base I have saved), becuase as I designed I started to wonder, "maybe I will do grid afterall". After testing on the grid, flexbox seemed more appropriate due to the amount of main themes.

Responsiveness:
- I used em measurments as opposed to pixels in order to maintain text responsiveness. I tested with a few measurements, but 1em seemed to display the best on my mobile version.

Push Buttons:
- This is my greatest concern on this design. I decided to make them card "buttons" after some research. It took a lot of trial and error here. 
- I made them 100px height to have them a bit more "boxy" for mobile display, and kept the rounded edges for visual appeal.
- The image background adds visual impact and contextual clues to the reader.
