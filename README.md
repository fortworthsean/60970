This has been a fun, rewarding, and sometimes stressful learning experience. I am going to have some cleanup to do. My images are terrible and I cannot seem to get them into unifrom buttons.This assignment forced me to reflect and review on many concepts from class where I did not realize I was lacking. I had a mess of 370 lines of CSS at one point. Ex: I was entering font choices in every section, yet they were all inhereted by the body. Such a simple and obvious mistake. I still have a bit of redundancy to clean next week, but was afraid to ruin what I had at the moment.

Content choices:

I thought I would go with a grid at first, but flexbox seemed more appropriate due to the limited amount of main themes.


Design Elements:
- I used em measurments in text as opposed to pixels in order to maintain text responsiveness. I tested with a few measurements, but 1em seemed to display the best on my mobile version. I scaled up on tablet and desktop, and had to do a bit of trial/error to get the tablet in a decent spot.
- I set margins and padding to create space around all content for contrast.
- I added alt text to images using our prompt from last week, to ensure accessible content.
- I set the margins to show a bit of space for mobile call-out. Hopefully not too much space.
- I added hover and focus states for accessibility.
- In order to enabkle the user to go through the entire work chronologically, I removed buttons dependant on chronological order. This ensures the next item they see when they finish reading is the next paragraph of the paper.

Push Buttons:
- My pictures are awful and the buttons are not matching in size becuase my images are different sizes, but I have spent countless hours on this and need to move on until next week.
- I still have a weird blue underline in my buttons, and I cannot seem to fix it. I am lost on this at the moment.
- This is my greatest concern on this design. I decided to make them card "buttons" after some research. It took a lot of trial and error here but I liked how it looked before I added in the images. 
- I made them 100px height to have them a bit more "boxy" for mobile display, and kept the rounded edges for visual appeal.
- The image background adds visual impact and contextual clues to the reader.
