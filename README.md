Wow. This has been a fun, rewarding, and very stressful leanring experience. I am not done yet and have spent hours deleting and adjusting code. I think I am going to have some cleanup to do, but this has been agreat learnign experience. Because I was completing this project more independently, based on what I havw already been taight, it forced me to reflect and review on many concepts from class. I enjoy hands-on learning.

I thought I would go with a grid at first, but my subject matter felt direct enough to go with a flex only. I created a seperate gridtesting file (I did not want to ammend the base I have saved), becuase as I designed I thought, "maybe I will do grid afterall". I hope I am making the correct design choice, but I think with four very pointed "main points", a flexbox only design may be enough.
