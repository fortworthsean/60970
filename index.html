    <h1>Family Adventures</h1>
    <body>
    <p>My wife, Lauren, along with our two children, Adam and Lorelei, love to explore the world and broaden our perspectives through cultural experiences and learning. Instead of accumulating more gifts and "stuff," we've chosen to travel and create unique family experiences in place of material presents. </strong> </p>

<h2>France</h2>

    <p> Over the past five years, I've spent time learning the French language and studying French history. For our tenth anniversary in 2024, Lauren and I explored Alsace, Champagne, and Paris. This past year, we took the whole family to Provence, the French Riviera, and back to Paris again. It was incredible to see the scenery of Arles, where Van Gogh once painted, and then to see the original paintings in person at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris.</p>

<h2>Latin America</h2>

    <p> Born and raised in the Texas Panhandle with Cherokee heritage, I grew up with a fascination with how Native American and European cultures clashed during the colonization of the Americas. Some of my most nostalgic childhood memories are the times I spent in the plaza in Santa Fe, New Mexico. This inclination has drawn me to study the rich history of Latin America. In the past three years, we've explored Mexico, and we have trips planned for Central and South America in the near future.</p>
